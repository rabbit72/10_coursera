# Coursera Dump

This script writes data about 20 random courses in an Excel spreadsheet.

Each course on a new line with these columns:

```'name', 'language', 'start_date', 'weeks_number', 'user_rating'```

# How to install

Python 3 should be already installed. Then use pip (or pip3 if there is a conflict with old Python 2 setup) to install dependencies:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Quick start

```bash
$ python3 coursera.py <path_to_save_directory>
```
Running on Windows is similar.

*(Possibly requires call of 'python' executive instead of just 'python3'.)*
